To determine the model's effectiveness at Iris classification, pass some sepal and petal measurements to the model and ask the model to predict what Iris species they represent. Then compare the model's prediction against the actual label.  For example, a model that picked the correct species on half the input examples has an *[accuracy](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#accuracy)* of `0.5`. Figure 4 shows a slightly more effective model, getting 4 out of 5 predictions correct at 80% accuracy:\n",
